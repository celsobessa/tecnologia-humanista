Chamada para artigos tem data final para envio no dia 1.o de novembo de 2024, com o tema Salvaguardas individuais e justiça na regulamentação da IA.


> _"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming various sectors of society, raising questions about fairness, equity, and justice in the development and deployment of these technologies. As AI systems increasingly influence decisions that impact individuals and communities, it is crucial to ensure that these systems are designed and implemented in ways that promote fairness and prevent harm. For this themed issue of the Cambridge Forum on AI: Law and Governance, we invite authors to submit papers that explore the dimensions of fairness from the individual’s perspective, examining the types, methods, and effectiveness of individual safeguards that should be provided across the various sectors where AI technologies are becoming prominent and where the risk of harm is increasingly significant."_
